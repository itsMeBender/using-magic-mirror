# Contributing

Hi, it's nice if you want to contribute to this project.  

Currently the impact of the project is small. I had one goal;

> Create software to generate content for the Raspberry Pi magic Mirror project.  
> Use Web Components.  

If you have other ideas, improvements, please add them.

Have fun,
Pieter
